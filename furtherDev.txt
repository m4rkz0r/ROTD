If this project was to go into a live environment, I would add the following features:

- A correct database schema model for the dataset
- API Versioning for future scalability and ensuring backward compatibility
- Rate Limiting and Throttling to prevent abuse or overuse
- Authentication and Authorization to ensure only authenticated users can access the API and to control what actions they can perform
- Caching to improve the performance of the API
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment process
- Database Indexing and Optimization to improve the performance of database queries
- Data Migrations to manage changes to the database schema
- More robust Error Handling and Logging to track errors and monitor the health of the API
